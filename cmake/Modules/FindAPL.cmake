# - Find INTEL MKL library
#
# This module sets the following variables:
#  MKL_FOUND - set to true if a library implementing the CBLAS interface is found
#  MKL_VERSION - best guess of the found mkl version
#  MKL_INCLUDE_DIR - path to include dir.
#  MKL_LIBRARIES - list of libraries for base mkl
#  MKL_OPENMP_TYPE - OpenMP flavor that the found mkl uses: GNU or Intel
#  MKL_OPENMP_LIBRARY - path to the OpenMP library the found mkl uses
#  MKL_LAPACK_LIBRARIES - list of libraries to add for lapack
#  MKL_SCALAPACK_LIBRARIES - list of libraries to add for scalapack
#  MKL_SOLVER_LIBRARIES - list of libraries to add for the solvers
#  MKL_CDFT_LIBRARIES - list of libraries to add for the solvers

# Do nothing if MKL_FOUND was set before!
